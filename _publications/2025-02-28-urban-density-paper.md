title: "Effects of Urban Density in the Developing World: Evidence from Daylight Hour Regulation in China"
collection: work in progress
Abstract: 'By 2050, 1.2 billion people are expected to migrate to urban
 areas, primarily in developing countries. Despite the scale of this
 transformation, most empirical research on urban density focuses
 on developed countries, leaving a gap in understanding its effects in
 the developing world. This paper addresses this gap by providing
 causal evidence on the impact of urban density using exogenous vari
ation from Daylight Hour Regulation (DHR) in China. We find that
 higher density increases PM2.5 concentrations and reduces green
 space, but also boosts GDP and accelerates urban development.
 When only considering PM2.5 and GDP, two critical effects, the ur
ban density is associated with significant net benefits. By extending
 this analysis to a developing-country context and uncovering key
 mechanisms, our findings provide critical insights for policymakers
 navigating rapid urban expansion in the developing countries.'
